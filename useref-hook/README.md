Imagine you have a magic spyglass. This spyglass can help you keep an eye on something special. Now, in the world of coding (making computer programs), we have a tool called useRef that works a bit like this magic spyglass.

When we use useRef, we are creating a magical tag that we can attach to something in our computer program. This tag helps us remember and find that special thing later, without using any spells or magic words.

For example, let's say we have a treasure chest (which is like an input box on a computer screen), and we want to know if someone is looking inside it. We use our magic spyglass (useRef) and put a tag on the treasure chest. Now, whenever someone opens or interacts with the chest, we know about it because of our magical tag.
